![Mockup of the layout](mockup.jpg)

This repository stores the layout of the NFT exchange website.

For ease of development, a modular approach was used using a style preprocessor **SCSS**. Also, to increase the speed of work and solve repetitive tasks, **Gulp** task manager was used.

The web page is responsive and displays well on different devices with different screen sizes. For the purpose of adaptability, the main menu is displayed completely on desktop devices, and is also implemented as a burger menu that works on tablets and mobile devices.
